# nDrive-Finance-Frontend
A mock auto finance company website, and my capstone project from General Assembly's SEI course.

The site's layout is inspired by CNAC.com, and the nDrive name is inspired by Reynold's and Reynold's slogan to "Put your career nDrive"

- http://www.cnac.com/
- https://www.reyrey.com/

Created using various technologies detailed below, this project is intended to show my skills as a web developer and my willingness to continue learning. Technologies not taught to me in class will also be listed below, as well as ones used that were only a small "bonus lecture". I chose to create this site as my capstone due to my passion with the automotive industry, as well as seeing ways that I could improve upon the user experience at http://www.cnac.com. 

### Screenshots
Below are a few screenshots comparing the CNAC site to nDrive site.


## Features/User stories
Below are the listed completed and/or planned features of the website, those original to the cnac website will be marked using a " * " at the end, others are ones that I have added to aid in either ease of use, or overall functionality of the website.

### Basic Features (MVP)
- A user can sign in using Google, Facebook, or Windows *
- A user can view their accounts balance, as well as payment history *
  - While this can be done on the cnac website, I intend to reorganize this content to be easier to view.
- A user can make/set payments on the site instead of having to call support *
- A user can easily view details of their loan such as interest rate, payment amount, next payment due date, and other notable information *
  - While most of this can be done on the cnac website, I intend to add more information, as well as make it easier to find this information.

# Extra Features (Post-MVP)
- A user can sign in using an account not aligned with any other tech company for privacy and those worried about data leaks.
- A user can easily reach a support agent for answering questions regarding their loan using a chat feature built into the website.
